# Security Topics Tree
Sometimes you just need to know what to Google...

If you're learning about computer security, you'll find an enormous amount of material and subjects you can study. "Computer Security" is a *very* broad field with lots of topics on both sides of Offense and Defense.

This diagram is meant to help with figuring out what you want to learn more about next. Find a branch that looks interesting and start looking up some of the terms and topics on that branch. 

At the moment, this is not a list of tools to try or specific resources to use, just a way to help figure out what you might be interested in.


### Contributing
Initially, I've added pretty much all the security-related topics I could think of as well as a few categories from [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) and the [Kali Linux Tools Listing](http://tools.kali.org/tools-listing).

If you'd like to contribute some topics, switch to the gh-pages branch of this repo and you'll find the *topics.json* file. The diagram is generated from this json file.


The original code for this diagram comes from [this D3 tree diagram example](http://bl.ocks.org/robschmuecker/7880033). I've modified some formatting and swapped out the json file.
